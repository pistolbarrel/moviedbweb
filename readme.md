# moviedbweb

moviedbweb is a personal project I started to try and learn some new skills. It's also a hobby gone wild. I love movies
as well as lists. So, why not list all movies I watched with some extra data to let one's imagination go with looking up
more movies based on the one you just enjoyed. I didn't want to recreate IMDB since that's out there already. I just
wanted to be able to have something that might remind me of the movie when I read it.
